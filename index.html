						<ul class="bulletless spaced-list dashed-list small">
							<li><b>Operational Reporting -</b> Structured format. Requires understanding of user.</li>
							<li><b>Ad-hoc Reporting -</b> Aids report creation for a specific business question.</li>

						<h3><i class="icon-plug"></i> How are BI &amp; DW used?</h3>
					</section>
					<section>
						The Business Intelligence applications act as the front end to access and analyse the data held within a Data Warehouse.
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>A BI Portal acts as the interface for the Data Warehouse and Business Intelligence applications.</h4>
						<br/>
						<p class="fragment fade-in"><i class="icon-globe"></i>Usually this is as a browser application.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h5>This portal should be -</h5>
						<ul class="bulletless spaced-list dashed-list">
							<li><b>Usable - </b>it should be easy to find things.</li>
							<li><b>Content Rich - </b>it should contain reports and analytical functionality as well as documentation, support etc.</li>
							<li><b>Consistent - </b>it should ideally look and feel similar to other applications the organisation uses.</li>
							<li><b>Current - </b>it should be updated regularly.</li>
							<li><b>Value Oriented - </b>it must make the user feel that it is worth using.</li>
						</ul>

						<h3><i class="icon-chart-line"></i> Current Trends</h3>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>Back in 2009 there was a <a href="http://www.information-management.com/specialreports/2009_148/business_intelligence_data_vizualization_social_networking_analytics-10015628-1.html">report</a> predicting the top BI trends -</p>
						<ul class="bulletless spaced-list dashed-list">
							<li>Green Computing</li>
							<li>Social Networking Services</li>
							<li>Data Visualisation</li>
							<li>Mobile BI</li>
							<li>Predictive Analysis</li>
							<li>Composite Applications</li>
							<li>Cloud Computing</li>
							<li>Multitouch</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>As of today, what are the state of these areas?</h4>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h5>Green Computing</h5>
						<hr/>
						<p>Ideas on topics of data compression and general processing acceleration for hardware and software generally lead to lower power consumption, contributing to a greener approach.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h5>Green Computing</h5>
						<hr/>
						<aside class="notes">
							As an added benefit, they can also increase performance and efficiency.
						</aside>
						<p>Data Warehouses may exist in <b>Data Centers</b>, which have had several best practices guides proposed, such as <a href="http://www1.eere.energy.gov/femp/pdfs/eedatacenterbestpractices.pdf">one by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory for the U.S. Department of Energy</a> in 2011.</p>
						<p>These guides suggest approaches such as waste heat recycling, on-site generation, cooling systems, and air management.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h5>Social Networking Services</h5>
						<hr/>
						<p>In 2009, Facebook had <a href="http://www.statista.com/statistics/264810/number-of-monthly-active-facebook-users-worldwide/"><b>360 million</b> monthly active users.</a></p>
						<p class="fragment fade-in">By 2014, they had <a href="http://www.statista.com/statistics/264810/number-of-monthly-active-facebook-users-worldwide/"><b>1,393 million</b> monthly active users.</a></p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h5>Social Networking Services</h5>
						<hr/>
						<p>There have been issues with bringing together the traditional quantitative data and the qualitative social media data.</p>
						<p>This issue is lessened by BI systems that can manage both structured and unstructured data.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h5>Social Networking Services</h5>
						<hr/>
						<p>There are still issues with privacy in this area that have yet to be fully considered.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>Privacy</h4>
						<hr/>
						<p class="fragment fade-in">In 2000, Latanya Sweeney found that <b>87%</b> of all Americans could be identified with only <b>3</b> pieces of information - (ZIP code, birthdate, sex).</p>
						<p class="fragment fade-in">In 2012, <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2012/02/16/how-target-figured-out-a-teen-girl-was-pregnant-before-her-father-did/">Target figured out a girl was pregnant before her father knew.</a></p>

					</section>
					<section>
						<h5>Social Business Intelligence</h5>
						<hr/>
						<p>At the moment this is a growing area that's branching in two different directions.</p>
						<ul class="bulletless dashed-list">
							<li>The first uses social tools to collaborate on business intelligence.</li>
							<li>The second uses business intelligence tools on the social media itself, internally and externally.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>A product of the second approach is the <a href="http://socialbusinessindex.com/">Social Business Index</a>, launched in 2011, that provides an insight into how 'social' a company is.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h5>Data Visualisation</h5>
						<hr/>
						<aside class="notes">
							Improves response times, greater simplicity, easier pattern (trend) visualisation, enhanced collaboration.
						</aside>
						<p>This has become an <a href="http://www.datapine.com/blog/bi-software-buyer-trends/">overwhelmingly important factor in first-time BI buyers.</a> (40% mention is as their top priority.)</p>
						<p>It is closely linked to dashboards. <br/> (Which ~100% of buyers cite as their top requested tool.)</p>
						<p>With the growing use and complexity of BI, it is more important to make the information easier to consume.</p>
						<p>This is area is impacting on Mobile BI.</p>
						<p>Used with the <b>Storytelling</b> approach as an effective way to convey data.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h5>Storytelling</h5>
						<hr/>
						<p>Some may struggle with data-driven decision making because they don’t know the story behind the data.</p>
						<p>The idea is that the visualisation is something that is created from the story.</p>
						<p>AIm to influence and enagage on an emotional and logical level.</p>
						<p>Can allow interactive exploration or perhaps acts as graphical elements with an intended interface.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h5>Mobile BI</h5>
						<hr/>
						<aside class="notes">
							CFO = Chief Financial Officier
						</aside>
						<p>There remains issues with this, and Mobile BI is still in the <a href="http://www.informationweek.com/software/information-management/mobile-business-intelligence-best-in-class-secrets-to-success/d/d-id/1074657?">'early adopter'</a> phase, and has yet to fully mature.</p>
						<p>Some issues include Security Considerations at different levels.</p>
						<p>Despite this, in a June 2012 CFO Magazine Survey, 89% ranked Mobility as the #1 technology of importance to their company's success over the next three years.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h5>Mobile BI</h5>
						<hr/>
						<p>MicroStrategy released MicroStrategy Mobile for <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/200518/article.html">iPhone</a> in 2010, and an <a href="http://www.bryanbrandow.com/2011/10/microstrategy-mobile-for-android.html">Android</a> version followed shortly in 2011.</p>
						<p>JasperSoft also provided an open source SDK to help build mobile BI apps alongside their own native iPhone, and non-native iPad apps.</p>
						<p>There are other Mobile BI products, such as <a href="http://www.oracle.com/us/solutions/business-analytics/business-intelligence/mobile/overview/index.html">Oracle Business Intelligence Mobile</a>, <a href="http://www-03.ibm.com/software/products/en/business-intelligence">IBM's Cognos Business Intelligence</a>, and <a href="http://www.tableau.com/products/server">Tableau Server</a>.</p>

						<h3><i class="icon-lightbulb"></i> Looking to the Future</h3>
					</section>
					<section>
						<ul class="bulletless spaced-list dashed-list">
							<li>General all around improvements to response time, scaling and concurrency.</li>
							<li>Real-time, or close to it.</li>
							<li>Open source replacing vendor. (JasperReports, Pentaho)</li>
							<li>Expanding to use more unstructured data.</li>
							<li>Even more social media and external data. - intermediaries who rate data quality.</li>
							<li>An increase in storytelling use in data visualisation.</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>Real-time, expanding to unstructured data</h4>
						<hr/>
						<p>Recent entrants into the BI space include Zoomdata (founded 2012), which focuses on <b>real-time</b> and <b>unstructured</b> data, via data models in Hadoop, MongoDB or Cassandra.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>Storytelling</h4>
						<p>In 2014 storytelling was a popular subject of dicussion, including by the likes of <a href="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/articles/tell-meaningful-stories-with-data.html">Google</a> and <a href="https://hbr.org/2013/04/how-to-tell-a-story-with-data/">Harvard Business Review</a>.</p>
						<p>Google in particular suggests that a hybrid author-reader approach based on research by the <a href="http://vis.stanford.edu/papers/narrative">Standford Visualisation Group</a>, with them demonstrating the approach via their <a href="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/tools/customer-journey-to-online-purchase.html">The Customer Journey to Online Purchase Tool</a>.</p>
						<p>This approach is similar to the <a href="http://datajournalismhandbook.org/">Data Journalism</a> trend that is occuring in media, and the fact that some BI systems are now being used in this area as well may impact the path they will take, or may create new, specialised, systems.</p>

						<h3>Companies Future Outlooks</h3>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>SAP's Outlook</h4>
						<hr/>
						<aside class="notes">
							Questioned by some, due to profit hit.
							Profit hit likely to be temporary, future profits increased.
							Worth mentioning competition (Salesforce) and cut to profits.
							Talk about BusinessObjects.
						</aside>
						<p>In 2014 <a href="http://www.aberdeen.com/research/8906/rr-analytics-cloud-saas-bi/content.aspx">research</a> indicates that employees are more likely to use cloud-based BI tools compared to traditional tools.</p>
						<p><a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/102100885">Focusing on the Cloud</a>, with recent acquisitions and the launch of Hana Cloud, which can be used to deploy Business Intelligence. In such a case Hana can be used as a platform and as a data source.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>Microsoft</h4>
						<hr/>
						<aside class="notes">
							Similar to IBM Watson analysis and big data.
						</aside>
						<p>In 2014 Microsoft released <a href="http://powerbi.com/">PowerBI</a>, their move into the Business Intelligence sector.</p>
						<p>A key feature of PowerBI is that it provides access to <a href="https://gigaom.com/2013/10/13/a-peek-inside-microsofts-new-design-first-development-strategy/">natural language queries</a>.</p>
						<p>They are also looking to incorporate the newly launched <a href="https://gigaom.com/2014/06/16/microsoft-to-provide-drag-and-drop-machine-learning-on-azure/">Azure Machine Learning Service</a>.</p>
						<p>The inclusion of Machine Learning will allow applications to not only provide current status results and responses to queries, but to also begin to make predictions, play out hypothetical scenarios and also to learn to make suggestions.</p>
