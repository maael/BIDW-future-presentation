						<h3><i class="icon-chart-line"></i> Current Trends</h3>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>Back in 2009 there was a <a href="http://www.information-management.com/specialreports/2009_148/business_intelligence_data_vizualization_social_networking_analytics-10015628-1.html">report</a> predicting the top BI trends -</p>
						<ul class="bulletless spaced-list dashed-list">
							<li>Green Computing</li>
							<li>Social Networking Services</li>
							<li>Data Visualisation</li>
							<li>Mobile BI</li>
							<li>Predictive Analysis</li>
							<li>Composite Applications</li>
							<li>Cloud Computing</li>
							<li>Multitouch</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>As of today, what are the state of these areas?</h4>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h5>Green Computing</h5>
						<hr/>
						<p>Ideas on topics of data compression and general processing acceleration for hardware and software generally lead to the idea of lower power consumption, contributing to a greener approach.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h5>Green Computing</h5>
						<hr/>
						<p>Data Warehouses may exist in <b>Data Centers</b>, which have had several best practices guides proposed, such as <a href="http://www1.eere.energy.gov/femp/pdfs/eedatacenterbestpractices.pdf">one by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory for the U.S. Department of Energy</a> in 2011.</p>
						<p>These guides suggest approaches such as waste heat recycling, on-site generation, cooling systems, and air management. As an added benefit, they can also increase performance and efficiency.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h5>Social Networking Services</h5>
						<hr/>
						<p>In 2009, Facebook had <a href="http://www.statista.com/statistics/264810/number-of-monthly-active-facebook-users-worldwide/"><b>360 million</b> monthly active users.</a></p>
						<p class="fragment fade-in">By 2014, they had <a href="http://www.statista.com/statistics/264810/number-of-monthly-active-facebook-users-worldwide/"><b>1,393 million</b> monthly active users.</a></p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h5>Social Networking Services</h5>
						<hr/>
						<p>There have been issues with bringing together the traditional quantitative data and the qualitative social media data.</p>
						<p>This issue is lessened by BI systems that can manage both structured and unstructured data.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h5>Social Networking Services</h5>
						<hr/>
						<p>There are still issues with privacy in this area that have yet to be fully considered.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>Privacy</h4>
						<hr/>
						<p class="fragment fade-in">In 2000, Latanya Sweeney found that <b>87%</b> of all Americans could be identified with only <b>3</b> pieces of information - (ZIP code, birthdate, sex).</p>
						<p class="fragment fade-in">In 2012, <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2012/02/16/how-target-figured-out-a-teen-girl-was-pregnant-before-her-father-did/">Target figured out a girl was pregnant before her father knew.</a></p>

					</section>
					<section>
						<h5>Social Business Intelligence</h5>
						<hr/>
						<p>At the moment this is a growing area that's growing in mainly two different directions.</p>
						<ul class="bulletless dashed-list">
							<li>The first uses social tools to collaborate on business intelligence.</li>
							<li>The second uses business intelligence tools on the social media itself, internally and externally.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>A product of the second approach is the <a href="http://socialbusinessindex.com/">Social Business Index</a>, launched in 2011, that provides an insight into how 'social' a company is.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h5>Data Visualisation</h5>
						<hr/>
						<aside class="notes">
							Improves response times, greater simplicity, easier pattern (trend) visualisation, enhanced collaboration.
						</aside>
						<p>This has become an <a href="http://www.datapine.com/blog/bi-software-buyer-trends/">overwhelmingly important factor in first-time BI buyers.</a> (40% mention is as their top priority.)</p>
						<p>It is closely linked to dashboards. <br/> (Which ~100% of buyers cite as their top requested tool.)</p>
						<p>With the growing use and complexity of BI, it is more important to make the information easier to consume.</p>
						<p>This is area is impacting on Mobile BI.</p>
						<p>Used with the <b>Storytelling</b> approach as an effective way to convey data.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h5>Mobile BI</h5>
						<hr/>
						<p>There remains issues with this, and Mobile BI is still in the <a href="http://www.informationweek.com/software/information-management/mobile-business-intelligence-best-in-class-secrets-to-success/d/d-id/1074657?">'early adopter'</a> phase, and has yet to fully mature.</p>
						<p>Some issues include Security Considerations at different levels.</p>
						<p>Despite this, in a June 2012 CFO Magazine Survey, 89% ranked Mobility as the #1 technology of importance to their company's success over the next three years.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h5>Mobile BI</h5>
						<hr/>
						<p>MicroStrategy released MicroStrategy Mobile for <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/200518/article.html">iPhone</a> in 2010, and an <a href="http://www.bryanbrandow.com/2011/10/microstrategy-mobile-for-android.html">Android</a> version followed shortly in 2011.</p>
						<p>JasperSoft also provided an open source SDK to help build mobile BI apps alongside their own native iPhone, and non-native iPad apps.</p>
						<p>There are other Mobile BI products, such as <a href="http://www.oracle.com/us/solutions/business-analytics/business-intelligence/mobile/overview/index.html">Oracle Business Intelligence Mobile</a>, <a href="http://www-03.ibm.com/software/products/en/business-intelligence">IBM's Cognos Business Intelligence</a>, and <a href="http://www.tableau.com/products/server">Tableau Server</a>.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h5>Cloud Computing</h5>
						<hr/>
						<p>In 2014 <a href="http://www.aberdeen.com/research/8906/rr-analytics-cloud-saas-bi/content.aspx">research</a> indicates that employees are more likely to use cloud-based BI tools compared to traditional tools.</p>
						<p>Considered to be an important factor by SAP, as they cut their profit in 2014 to accelerate their move into cloud software.</p>

						<h3><i class="icon-lightbulb"></i> Looking to the Future</h3>
					</section>
					<section>
						<ul class="bulletless spaced-list dashed-list">
							<li>General all around improvements to response time, scaling and concurrency.</li>
							<li>Real-time, or close to it.</li>
							<li>Open source replacing vendor.</li>
							<li>Increasing interest in Software-as-a-Service. (SaaS)</li>
							<li>Expanding to use more unstructured data.</li>
							<li>Even more social media and external data. - intermediaries who rate data quality.</li>
							<li>An increase in storytelling use in data visualisation.</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>Real-time, expanding to unstructured data</h4>
						<hr/>
						<p>Recent entrants into the BI space include Zoomdata (founded 2012), which focuses on <b>real-time</b> and <b>unstructured</b> data, via data models in Hadoop, MongoDB or Cassandra.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>Storytelling</h4>
						<p>In 2014 storytelling was a popular subject of dicussion, including by the likes of <a href="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/articles/tell-meaningful-stories-with-data.html">Google</a> and <a href="https://hbr.org/2013/04/how-to-tell-a-story-with-data/">Harvard Business Review</a>.</p>
						<p>Google in particular suggests that a hybrid author-reader approach based on research by the <a href="http://vis.stanford.edu/papers/narrative">Standford Visualisation Group</a>, with them demonstrating the approach via their <a href="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/tools/customer-journey-to-online-purchase.html">The Customer Journey to Online Purchase Tool</a>.</p>
						<p>This approach is similar to the <a href="http://datajournalismhandbook.org/">Data Journalism</a> trend that is occuring in media, and the fact that some BI systems are now being used in this area as well may impact the path they will take, or may create new, specialised, systems.</p>

						<h4>SAP's Outlook</h4>
						<hr/>
						<aside class="notes">
							Questioned by some, due to profit hit.
							Profit hit likely to be temporary, future profits increased.
							Worth mentioning competition.
						</aside>
						<p><a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/102100885">Focusing on the Cloud</a>, with recent acquisitions and the launch of Hana Cloud.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>Microsoft</h4>
						<hr/>
						<p>In 2014 Microsoft released <a href="http://powerbi.com/">PowerBI</a>, their move into the Business Intelligence sector.</p>
						<p>A key feature of PowerBI is that it provides access to <a href="https://gigaom.com/2013/10/13/a-peek-inside-microsofts-new-design-first-development-strategy/">natural language queries</a>.</p>
						<p>They are also looking to incorporate the newly launched <a href="https://gigaom.com/2014/06/16/microsoft-to-provide-drag-and-drop-machine-learning-on-azure/">Azure Machine Learning Service</a>.</p>
